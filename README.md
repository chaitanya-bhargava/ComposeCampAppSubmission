# Compose Camp App Submission
### I have chosen to build a clone app of Instagram with 4 working screens:
1. Login Screen 
2. Home Screen 
3. Messages Screen 
4. Profile Screen 

### I have used all the concepts and libraries taught to us in the 4 sessions held over the course of the camp

## Login Screen

As the app is in early stages, the login ability is stubbed and can only work with the following credentials:
<br/>
<b>Username : testadmin, Password : 12345</b>
<br/>

There is provision of a show password button as well

## Home Screen

On logging in the app opens up into a home screen with a carousel of posts and stories, also with a NavBar on the top with icon buttons for the Home, Messages and Profile Screen including a Logout button.
